<h1>First Prompt</h1>
<p>Do you think your local butcher will reduce the amount of meat she orders from the slaughterhouse if you become a vegetarian? Of course not! The supply chain for meat just isn’t sensitive to the quantities that a single person consumes. So, by becoming a vegetarian, you’ll never save a single animal’s life! But by becoming a vegetarian, you’ll deprive yourself of the pleasure of eating meat, and you should only do that if the benefits would outweigh the losses. Therefore, you should only become a vegetarian if doing so would save some animals’ lives.</p>

<h1>Second Prompt</h1>
<p>I don’t think that humans should become biologically immortal. Due to natural selection and the process of evolution, each new generation of humans is slightly better adapted to survive than the one before it. If an entire generation were to become biologically immortal, this process would basically stagnate. Any future generations would have to be very small (or even nonexistent), because if there were a much lower death rate, we would have to limit the number of people born in order to preserve resources. Biological immortality would essentially stunt the evolutionary development of the entire human race.</p>

<h1>Third Prompt</h1>
<p>As nice as free college for everyone sounds, we shouldn’t let the state fund college education. First of all, that would be expensive for the state, and expensive state-funded programs often result in resources being thinly spread. So, with resources spread so thin, the quality of education offered would definitely suffer. More importantly, we don’t want the state to be in control of what we learn! If that were the case, then they could stop any criticism of the government and only promote their own ideas. That goes against the very essence of democracy!</p>

<h1>Fourth Prompt</h1>
<p>Raising the drinking age to 21 has done more than just save lives. At age 21, deaths, hospitalizations, and arrests all jump sharply as a result of increased alcohol consumption. Thus, if we made the drinking age earlier, we would just provide an earlier start for these destructive behaviors. Plus, lowering the drinking age would lower the perceived risk involved in consuming alcohol. When people perceive the risk from alcohol consumption as lower as it really is, they cannot accurately evaluate the risk involved in an action and make good decisions.</p>
