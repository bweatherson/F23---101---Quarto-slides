"AQ002N","Imagine that scientists invent a pill that makes you more creative, improves your memory, and increases your ability to concentrate. Now imagine that you took that pill and become vastly more talented than you naturally are. 

Some people believe that the talents such a pill would give you would be less authentic than talents that you were born with or worked for. However, we already accept many enhancement technologies: athletes wear fancy shoes and higher-level math students can use calculators. Essentially, once we master the basics of something, we want to understand more advanced topics. There is no point for a mathematician to do arithmetic by hand---she wouldn't learn anything new and it would take away time for focusing on interesting work. So, cognitive enhancement would actually make talents more authentic, because you could concentrate on complex, interesting topics instead of spending time on menial tasks like improving your ability to concentrate and memorize.","1","What is the main question that is at issue in this passage?","AQ002N_image_Q0.png","Whether scientists can invent a pill which makes us vastly more talented than we naturally are","Whether we accept many enhancement technologies","Whether scientists should invent a pill which makes us vastly more talented than we naturally are","Whether cognitive enhancement would make talents less authentic","Whether cognitive enhancement would help us concentrate on complex, interesting topics","Whether cognitive enhancement would make talents less authentic","The main issue that is at stake in this passage is whether cognitive enhancement would make talents less authentic."

The objection given to the claim that they are being charitable when they help each other is that a whale’s motives for helping another whale of a different species is to benefit its own chances of survival. This inference assumes that doing something to benefit one’s own chances of survival is not charitable. The reason given to directly support the claim that a whale’s motive for helping another whale of a different species is to benefit its own chances of survival is that whales evolved to help whales of other species because this increased the helper's own chances of survival. This inference assumes that the reason that a behavior evolved provides animals' motive for engaging in the behavior. The objection given to the claim that the reason that a behavior evolved provides animals’ motive for engaging in the behavior is that human beings evolved to eat sweets because doing so increased their chances of survival, but this not my motive for eating sweets today."

"FQ016E","Some claim that stem cell research is immoral because it requires the destruction of embryos. As human beings come into existence at the moment of conception, embryos are human beings. And as it is clearly wrong to kill human beings, it is wrong to kill embryos. However, consider the case of twinning. Any time before the two week point in fetal development, and embryo might split and develop into two individual infants. In such a case, what happens to the original embryo? It appears that either (a) the embryo survives as both twins, (b) the embryo survives as one twin or the other, or (c) the embryo does not survive. As the two twins will live individual lives, option (a) can't be right. Option (b) cannot be right, as it would be completely arbitrary for the embryo to survive as one twin or the other. So it must mean that the embryo doesn't survive. But if the embryo doesn't survive, that means a human being dies during twinning.
