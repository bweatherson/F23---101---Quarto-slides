MC, ,1,"Do you think your local butcher will reduce the amount of meat she orders from the slaughterhouse if you become a vegetarian? Of course not! The supply chain for meat just isn't sensitive to the quantities that a single person consumes. So, by becoming a vegetarian, you'll never save a single animal's life! But by becoming a vegetarian, you'll deprive yourself of the pleasure of eating meat, and you should only do that if the benefits would outweigh the losses.

MC, ,1,"I don't think that humans should become biologically immortal. Due to natural selection and the process of evolution, each new generation of humans is slightly better adapted to survive than the one before it. If an entire generation were to become biologically immortal, this process would basically stagnate. Any future generations would have to be very small (or even nonexistent), because if there were a much lower death rate, we would have to limit the number of people born in order to preserve resources.
