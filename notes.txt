Notes on Steele

Feasibility as a constraint on what?
    - Things that we ought work towards?
    - Things that are worth doing?

Two special features of climate action
    - International; should try to do things that will get international agreement
    - Inter-temporal; should try to do things that future governments will go along with

Feasibility and Morality
    - Feasibility isn't a question of evaluation. It would be good if I stopped global warming by an act of willpower, even though that's infeasible in a strong sense
    - In some cases it is a question of morality. If you say I ought to do something, that implies it is feasible for me to do it.
    - But we should be careful about feasibility and self-interest. If I don't rescue a drowning child, it isn't a great defence for me to say "Well, it wasn't in my self-interest to do that, so it wasn't feasible for me to do it."

Simple PD model
    - For every $1 a country spends up to some limit, each of 10 different countries will get 50 cents of benefit in terms of better climate.
    - Ideally we'd all spend up to the limit, right
    - But what each of us want is everyone else to spend up to the limit, and us to spend nothing
    - It's a silly model, but more realistic models give directionally the same answer

PD and self-interest
    - Odd assumption: US policy makers care about well-being of future Americans, but not at all about well-being of present Canadians.
    - Big question: Should a deal be better for everyone than the status quo, or should it be better than other things that are available?
    - If it's the former, it's probably easy to get a deal.
    - If it's the latter, it's going to be rather hard.

# Feasibility Essay Question

Posner and Weisbach say that we should focus our efforts on climate treaties that will leave every country better off than if the treaty did not exist. A key part of the argument is that countries will not willingly make sacrifices they get nothing from, so only these treaties are feasible. A cynic might say that even this isn't enough of a constraint to feasibility. Maybe the only feasible treaties are those where every country is better off following their obligations than breaching them. But treaties that satisfy this constraint will not be strong enough to avoid disaster.

1. Describe why the cynic's position is different to Posner and Weisbach.
2. Do you agree that "treaties that satisfy this constraint will not be strong enough to avoid disaster"? Why or why not?
3. Does the cynic have a good criticism of Posner and Weisbach? Why or why not?

# A Game

## A Game

We'll start with something that might feel very different from climate change. But hopefully the relevance will become clear in a second.

This is a version of what's sometimes called an investment game in economics.

## A Game

Pretend that we're playing the following two stage game.

1. First, each of you will choose to 'invest' 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 dollars.
2. Then, I'll add up how much everyone invested, multiply the amount by 5, and distribute that equally among everyone, whether you
