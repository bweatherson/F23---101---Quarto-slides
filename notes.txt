Notes on Steele

Feasibility as a constraint on what?
    - Things that we ought work towards?
    - Things that are worth doing?

Two special features of climate action
    - International; should try to do things that will get international agreement
    - Inter-temporal; should try to do things that future governments will go along with

Feasibility and Morality
    - Feasibility isn't a question of evaluation. It would be good if I stopped global warming by an act of willpower, even though that's infeasible in a strong sense
    - In some cases it is a question of morality. If you say I ought to do something, that implies it is feasible for me to do it.
    - But we should be careful about feasibility and self-interest. If I don't rescue a drowning child, it isn't a great defence for me to say "Well, it wasn't in my self-interest to do that, so it wasn't feasible for me to do it."

Simple PD model
    - For every $1 a country spends up to some limit, each of 10 different countries will get 50 cents of benefit in terms of better climate.
    - Ideally we'd all spend up to the limit, right
    - But what each of us want is everyone else to spend up to the limit, and us to spend nothing
    - It's a silly model, but more realistic models give directionally the same answer

PD and self-interest
    - Odd assumption: US policy makers care about well-being of future Americans, but not at all about well-being of present Canadians.
    - Big question: Should a deal be better for everyone than the status quo, or should it be better than other things that are available?
    - If it's the former, it's probably easy to get a deal.
    - If it's the latter, it's going to be rather hard.

# Feasibility Essay Question

Posner and Weisbach say that we should focus our efforts on climate treaties that will leave every country better off than if the treaty did not exist. A key part of the argument is that countries will not willingly make sacrifices they get nothing from, so only these treaties are feasible. A cynic might say that even this isn't enough of a constraint to feasibility. Maybe the only feasible treaties are those where every country is better off following their obligations than breaching them. But treaties that satisfy this constraint will not be strong enough to avoid disaster.

1. Describe why the cynic's position is different to Posner and Weisbach.
2. Do you agree that "treaties that satisfy this constraint will not be strong enough to avoid disaster"? Why or why not?
3. Does the cynic have a good criticism of Posner and Weisbach? Why or why not?

# Objection from Cynicism

## Two Comparisons

The cynic might say the following. It's not important that an agreement satisfy condition 1. It also has to satisfy condition 2.

1. Everyone following the agreement is better than no one following the agreement.
2. Your following the agreement is better than your not following it.

## Back to the Game

An agreement to all put in \$4 satisfies 1 but not 2.

1. We are all \$16 better off if we all put in \$4 rather than \$0.
2. No matter what everyone else, you are approximately \$4 better off not following the agreement than following it.

## Intertemporal Agreements

The big worry here is that the arguments we just made prove too much.

- If you're worried about future governments not honoring agreements, then the real standard is 2, not 1.
- When a future government is deciding whether to honor the agreement, they won't care about whether it would have been better or worse to not have made the agreement.
- They'll just care about, going forward, what's best.

## Putting the Two Objections Together

If you focus on morality, then countries should do things that would be for the best, even if they wouldn't make their own citizens better off.

If you focus on national self-interest, the feasible deals might be the ones that are worth making, **and** which are worth keeping.

But there might not be very many deals like that.

# Building a Better Deal

## Binding Agreements

When the parties to an agreement like this are people or corporations, we get around the problem here by using legally binding agreements.

We'll all enter into a deal knowing that the courts will enforce compliance.

::: {.fragment}
The problem is that there is no international court that can do this when the agreements are between countries.

## What Else Do We Have?

It's worth thinking through what other moves we have available here.

## Two Suggestions

There might be some grounds for hope here.

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
1. Rely on countries having a desire for a reputation for promise keeping.
2. Rely on people in countries having a desire to be part of agreements.
:::

## A Different Game

If either conditions hold, we might have a situation analogous to the following game.

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
1. At the first stage everyone decides whether to invest, or not invest, \$10.
2. At the second stage, if everyone invested, everyone is given \$25 (for a profit of \$15).
3. But if not everyone invested, everyone just gets \$5 (for either a \$5 profit if you didn't invest, or a \$5 loss if you did).
:::

## Two Game Types

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
- What game theorists call a **Prisoners Dilemma** is like the first game I discussed.
- What game theorists call a **Stag Hunt** is like the second game I discussed.
:::

Both games have cooperative and non-cooperative outcomes, but they have one important difference.

## Different Types

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
- In Prisoners Dilemma, cooperation is **costly**.
    - Whatever everyone else does, you are better off not cooperating.
- In Stag Hunt, cooperation is **risky**.
    - If you don't know what others will do, betting on cooperation is a very risky bet.
    - But if you know everyone else will cooperate, you're better off cooperating too.
:::

## Changing the Game Type

Can we create the second type of agreement?

- Possibly if governments (or their people) care about reputations for promise-keeping.
- And possibly if governments (or their people) care about international fairness.
- There is some evidence for both of these, though it's hard to be sure.

## Back to Feasibility

But if we have these conditions, should we even care about International Paretianism?

- I'm not sure - it does seem like a strange mix of moralism and cynicism.
- But maybe there are countries where the median voter will only agree to deals that are win-win, but will prefer keeping the deal even if there is a self-interested reason to break it.
