# Three Approaches to Ethics

## Three Approaches to Ethics

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
- **Dentology**
  - Follow rules.
- **Virtue Ethics**
  - Be a good person.
- **Consequentialism**
  - Make the world a better place.
:::

## And More

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
- Are these all the options?
  - No, though they are the biggest by far in recent-ish English language philosophy
- Are they incompatible?
  - No (version 1): you can be a pluralist.
  - No (version 2): you can argue that they are compatible.
  - No (version 3): you can mix and match.
:::

::: {.notes}
On 3, note for instance Julia Driver saying that good people are people who have characteristics which make the world a better place.

## Three Approaches to Ethics

In history of (western) philosophy, each of these three is identified with a famous old philosopher.

- A famous version of deontology was developed by Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)
- Aristotle (384 BCE - 322 BCE) is usually read as a virtue theorist.
- Consequentialism is associated with 19th century English philosophers, especially Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832).
  
## Consequentialism and Climate

The plan for this week is to talk about how consequentialism relates to climate change.

::: {.incremental}
- At first it seems like a good fit; what makes polluting behavior bad is that it has bad consequences.
- But the details get very messy very quickly.
:::

# Consequentialism and Climate

## Five Problems

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
- **Define consequences**
- **All options on the table**
- **Demandingness**
- **Cluelessness**
- **Efficacy**
:::

## What Are Consequences

We already talked about this a lot the last two weeks.

But there is this big picture question of how to compare two outcomes when one is better for some people and the other one is better for others.

We've done enough on that question for now.

## All Options on the Table

A traditional complaint about consequentialism is that in principle it has an anything goes approach to means.

- All that matters is producing the best outcome.
- So the ends always justify the means.
- If the best outcome involves a billion people being displaced, those people better get going on their passport applications.

## Demandingness

In its most common form, consequentialism is very demanding.

- It says to produce the **best** outcomes.
- Imagine (as is plausible) that having rice and beans for every meal, and sending the money you'd otherwise spend on food to buying malaria nets, would produce on balance a better world.
- Then, says the consequentialist, you should do that.

::: {.notes}
Note that malaria nets do seem, as best we can tell, a much better use of charitable dollars even than food aid.
:::

## Demandingness

This is related to Julia Nefsky's example of Green.

- Green is a basically environmentally sensitive person who does occasional things that are sub-optimal.
- According to the standard version of consequentialism, that means she's doing the wrong thing.

::: {.notes}
I mean, the occasional flight to Italy isn't actually the same as occasional drive to go hiking. Flying is a thing
:::

 
## Cluelessness

Here are two problem cases for the version of consequentialism that Bentham defended, which just said that goodness is producing the best outcome.

1. A drives in a really reckless way, and the result is that they get home a bit quicker and spend more time with their kids.
2. B rescues a drowning child, and that child grows up to be a serial killer.

::: {.notes}
Stress that these go in opposite directions.
Take some time spelling out the details.
:::

## Cluelessness

There is a standard solution to both of these problems.

Morality is not about producing the best outcomes, but the best **expected** outcomes.

## Expected Outcome

If there are a bunch of possible outcomes: $O_1, O_2, \dots$, the expected outcome is:

$$
Pr(O_1)V(O_1) + Pr(O_2)V(O_2) + \dots
$$

It's a bit more complicated if there are infinitely many options - then you use calculus - but that's the basic idea.

## Intuition

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
- The expected outcome is something like the average outcome.
- It is the average value you'd get if the option was repeated many times.
- That makes sense for things like drink driving; the expected outcome from drink driving just is the average outcome. And the average of making it home a bit earlier and a horrible crash is really bad.
- It's a little trickier for climate where we don't get to repeat our options, but that's the idea
:::

## Expected Outcome

It's going to matter here because Nefsky thinks (along with many others) that when it comes to climate:

- The probability that any one individual will make a big difference is incredibly small.
- And the differences we do make are (individually) probably tiny.

## Efficacy

So that brings us back (at last!) to the title of the paper.

The last worry is that although climate concerns are all about outcomes, the difference any one of us makes is arguably very small.

So maybe consequentialism does not say there is anything wrong with flying across the country for lunch.

## Dilemma

Nefsky poses this as a dilemma.

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
1. If we say that the only bad actions are ones where we can say clearly in advance what the bad consequences are, or at least what the (non-trivial) risk of a bad consequence is, then practically no individual actions that make the climate worse are morally bad.
2. If we say that anything that might make a difference is bad, then all of us are bad.

# Responses

## Three Big Responses

We'll talk more about the details of this argument on Thursday, but for now I just wanted to note three initial replies you might make.

1. Deontology
2. Virtue
3. Comparative consequentialism
