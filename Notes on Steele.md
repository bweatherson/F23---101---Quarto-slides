Notes on Steele

Feasibility as a constraint on what?
    - Things that we ought work towards?
    - Things that are worth doing?

Two special features of climate action
    - International; should try to do things that will get international agreement
    - Inter-temporal; should try to do things that future governments will go along with

Feasibility and Morality
    - Feasibility isn't a question of evaluation. It would be good if I stopped global warming by an act of willpower, even though that's infeasible in a strong sense
    - In some cases it is a question of morality. If you say I ought to do something, that implies it is feasible for me to do it.
    - But we should be careful about feasibility and self-interest. If I don't rescue a drowning child, it isn't a great defence for me to say "Well, it wasn't in my self-interest to do that, so it wasn't feasible for me to do it."

Simple PD model
    - For every $1 a country spends up to some limit, each of 10 different countries will get 50 cents of benefit in terms of better climate.
    - Ideally we'd all spend up to the limit, right
    - But what each of us want is everyone else to spend up to the limit, and us to spend nothing
    - It's a silly model, but more realistic models give directionally the same answer

PD and self-interest
    - Odd assumption: US policy makers care about well-being of future Americans, but not at all about well-being of present Canadians.
    - Big question: Should a deal be better for everyone than the status quo, or should it be better than other things that are available?
    - If it's the former, it's probably easy to get a deal.
    - If it's the latter, it's going to be rather hard.
