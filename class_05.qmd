# The List of Forms {background-color="#40666e"}

## Five Argument Forms

### We talked about these last time

1. Enumerative induction
2. Analogical inference
3. Inference to the best explanation
4. Causal inference
5. Testimony

## Four Questions

### Ideally we'd be able to say 'yes' to all four

1. Is every one of these a good form of inference?
2. Is the list non-redundant?
3. Is every one of them unified?
4. Is this it, is that all the forms?

## Four Questions

### With my answers

1. Is every one of these a good form of inference? [yes]{.fg style="--col: #228B22"}
2. Is the list non-redundant? [no]{.fg style="--col: #FF0000"}
3. Is every one of them unified? [no]{.fg style="--col: #FF0000"}
4. Is this it, is that all the forms? [no]{.fg style="--col: #FF0000"}

## Redundancy

### Explanation is causal explanation

First, it's important to note that everything in the next few slides is **controversial**. Philosophy doesn't always have clear answers.

But I think, following work by Michigan's Peter Railton, that explanation is causal explanation.

So causal inference and inference to the best explanation are sort of the same thing.

## Unification

### Internal and External Induction

I also think that we should think of inference out of a group (lots of campuses with coffee shops, so next campus has a coffee shop) and inference into a group (half of UM undergrads are from Michigan, so it's 50/50 this UM undergrad is from Michigan) as distinct forms of inference.

They have somewhat different failure conditions, for example.

## Completeness

### Moral, analytical, etc.

Here are two other kinds of inference we might use.

1. **Moral Inference**: Inferring from the description of a situation to a moral evaluation of it.
2. **Analytical Inference**: Inferring from the description of a situation to the applicability (or non-applicability) of a high-level concept to it.

Note the next slide is going to be more violent than most of our examples.

## Moral Inference

### Don't burn cats

1. Some teenagers have surrounded a scared cat, and are trying to pour gasoline on it and set it on fire.
2. Therefore, the teenagers are trying to do something wrong.

Actually, maybe even the attempt is wrong, so the conclusion could be stronger.

I think (controversially!) that this is good inference but doesn't fit any of these categories.

## Moral Inference

### Ought from an is

This is controversial because a lot of philosophers endorse the principle: **No ought from an is**.

This is often associated with the 18th century Scottish philosopher David Hume, who we're going to hear a lot more about.

## Moral Inference

### How moral inference works on Hume's picture

This doesn't mean those folks are ok with cat torture.

It means they think the inference I showed you is **incomplete**. It is what's sometimes called an **enthymeme**.

That means there is a hidden premise, something about the morality of cat torture, that I assumed but didn't say, and that's the real argument.

## Analytic Inference

### An old example, from 9th century Indian philosophy

A traveller is walking through the hills. He sees a black cloud over the next hill. It looks a lot like smoke, and he infers that there's a fire over the hill. There is a fire, but that cloud isn't smoke. It's some flies that have gathered over the fire.

## Poll

Does the traveller know that there is a fire over the hill?

A.  Yes
B.  No
C.  Unsure

## Analytic Inference

### How did you answer that question

If you answered 'Yes', or 'No' (which Dharmottara wanted you to answer), you must have inferred that from the description of the case.

Again, it's a bit controversial, but I think such inferences are warranted, and don't fit into any of the categories we've had so far.

## Pramāṇa

### An organising concept for Indian philosophy

It would be very good to have a list of inference forms where we could answer 'yes' to all four questions: reasonableness, non-redundancy, unification, and completeness.

Perhaps surprisingly, this question has often been central to 'Western' philosophy (meaning philosophy that comes out of the pagan/Jewish/Christian/Islamic traditions).

But it was very central to Indian philosophy, where the question of which methods were pramāṇas (means of knowledge/means of proof) was hotly debated, and often definitional of one school or other.

## Multi-Step Arguments

### Task: What are the premises and conclusion in this argument?

> I know the streets are wet. Everyone who walked into class was dripping wet. So it's raining. So the streets must be wet.

## Multi-Step Arguments

### It's a trick question

There are three steps here.

1. Everyone who walked into class was dripping wet.
2. It's raining.
3. The streets are wet.

And step 2 is both a conclusion, of an argument from 1, and a premise, of an argument that leads to 2. This structure, where a conclusion of an earlier argument becomes a premise of a later argument, is really common.

## Argument Maps

To present arguments like this, I'm going to use a new format, called **argument maps**.

This is, by philosophy standards, a very new idea - it was only developed in the last 20 years. (If Plato didn't know about an idea, we sometimes treat it as new.)

The next slide has one way we could present the argument from the last slide.

## Argument Maps

For reasons that I'll get to shortly, it's usually helpful to mark explicitly where an argument step occurs.

I'll do these with small circles. So the revised version of the map looks like this.

## Dots

We'll eventually have three reasons to include these dots.

One, that I actually won't make a huge use of, is that you can expand them to describe what kind of argument that you're using.

I do that on the next slide.

## Dots and Arguments

Another reason is that it lets you distinguish the following two cases.

1. Someone offers an argument with two premises for a particular conclusion.
2. Someone offers two distinct arguments, each with one premise, for the same conclusion.

## Multiple Arguments

This is something that happens a lot in philosophy.

A philosophy paper often won't just develop one argument for its main conclusion.

It will offer multiple reasons to believe the one conclusion.

## Single Argument with Two Premises

![The two arrows into the dot mean that these premises combine in the argument](argdown/05-04.png)

## Two Arguments with a Single Premise

![The dots mean there are two arguments](argdown/05-05.png)

## The Difference in Practice

It isn't always easy to tell when someone is offering one or the other of these argument forms.

The main thing we do is use the **principle of charity**.

If they offer P1 and P2 as premises, and neither of them on their own supports the conclusion, we should assume that they mean them to combine.

## The Difference in Practice

There are also signs that an author can use to indicate which of the two types they have in mind.

- If they explicitly refer to the **conjunction** of the two premises, e.g., they say "From this premise and that premise it follows that...", then they probably mean to indicate a single argument.
- If they say "From this premise, conclusion, and **also** this premise implies/supports..." they probably mean to offer two arguments.

## The Difference in Practice

Which kind of argument form the speaker is offering is important for thinking about which kinds of responses to their argument are going to work.

But that's something we'll deal with more next time, when we look in more details at the ways in which one can respond to arguments.
