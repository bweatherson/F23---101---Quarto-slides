# Arguing for a Premise

## Bonus Content

### We might not finish this, and if we don't we won't come back to it

Most everything I'm saying this week about arguments is useful whether you're doing philosophy, biology, English literature, or any other subject in the university.

But the pattern I'm about to describe comes up much more in philosophy than other areas.

## Arguing for a Premise

### Too much covering all the bases

Sometimes, a philosopher will be in the following situation.

- They have a nice argument for a conclusion $C$, and one of the premises is $P$.
- $P$ is very plausible, and like 80% of readers will accept it.
- But 20% of them won't, and for those 20%, the philosopher tries to come up with an argument for $P$.

## Arguing for a Premise

### Too much covering all the bases

So far this might seem familiar: $P$ goes from a premise to an intermediate conclusion.

But often enough in philosophy the following two things happen.

1. $P$ was actually a plausible premise; they should be allowed to have it as a starting point.
2. The argument for $P$ wasn't actually very good, and should be rejected.

## Arguing for a Premise

### Really two arguments

I think in these cases, we should think of the philosopher as offering **two arguments**.

One of them starts with $P$, one of them starts with the argument for $P$.

## A Real Life Case

In the early 1960s a philosopher at Wayne State University, Edmund Gettier, independently rediscovered cases like Dharmottara's case of the traveller. (He didn't know about Dharmottara, or afaik any other Indian philosophy.)

And he noted that they were problems for the following otherwise plausible theory of knowledge.

To know a proposition is to have a reasonable, true, belief in the proposition.

[Knowledge ≠ Reasonable True Belief]
   + <a1>
      + [P1] The traveller has a reasonable true belief that there's a fire.
      + [P2] The traveller does not know that there's a fire.
      

## Gettier's Argument

But Gettier at least did not stop there. He threw in, almost as an afterthought, the following argument for P2. (Actually for the equivalent of P2 in his, more convoluted, example.)

[P2] The traveller does not know that there's a fire.
   + <a1>
      + [P2a] You can't get knowledge by inference from a false premise.
      + [P2b] The traveller infers that there's a fire from a false premise.
      
## Knowledge and Falsity

### Big controversial claims

And P2a, that you can't get knowledge by inference from a false premise, is really controversial.

Possible counterexample: 19th century engineers used Newtonian physics in their calculations, which is only approximately true, i.e., not actually true.

But they knew a lot of things about which bridges would stand up.

## A Convoluted Argument Map

### Arguing for premises makes everything messy

It's really tricky to map out the argument here.

This isn't just because it's hard to draw the map, it's hard to make sense of the actual argument. I've tried on the next slide. (If you can't read it; I'll put these on Canvas. It is very small.)

And I think we'll get the same issue whenever someone puts forward a premise, and then throws in an argument for it.
