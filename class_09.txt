What is in the world?

Not just things it seems.
  - _Squid is sleeping_ isn't just made true by what exists (i.e., Squid), but by how it exists.
  - The same for _Squid loves Tree_, where Tree is a name for the cat tree that Squid typically sleeps in.
  - SLEEPING and LOVES seem to be required parts of metaphysics.
  
## Saving the Only Things Picture

An old way - just objects and resemblences that we project
  - No such thing as SLEEPING
  - When we say that Squid is sleeping, we mean that Squid resembles these particulars we've seen, which were sleeping
  - BR: What do you mean 'resembles'? That looks like a universal as well.
  - It's a universal relation, like LOVES, but still a universal.
  
A new way - just sets of objects
  - SLEEPING is something like the set of sleeping things
  - Alternatively, it is a function from things to truth-values, which is (intuitively) T when the thing is sleeping, and F otherwise.
  - First worry: Not really just things, also sets, and sets are weird.
  - Second: There are too many sets. There is also the set that contains all the other sleeping things, and Tree rather than Squid. This has all sorts of consequences.
  - How do we learn that 'sleeping' means SLEEPING and not some other set? If there are real universals, this is easy. If not,...
  - That Squid is sleeping seems to _explain_ some things (e.g., why the house is so quiet). Squid being in some set doesn't explain anything - she's infinitely many sets.
  - That Squid is sleeping seems to imply that she resembles, at least in some respect, other sleeping things. But being in a set together is not a form of resemblence. Any two things are in some set together.
  - There are things one can say back to each of these criticisms, but they are often taken to be bad new for the idea that there are just objects and sets of objects.
  
## Some Questions about Universals

Abundant or Sparse
  - BR seems to think that there are *lots* of universals; maybe one for each word.
  - That's not a common view these days. More common to say that there are a handful of universals.
  - In particular, there are only as many universals as are needed to explain facts of resemblence.
  - So there may not be a universal for PUMPKIN SPICE LATTE. Maybe each of PUMPKIN, SPICE, and LATTE are universals. But once we've got all of them (and understood how they modify other universals), we don't have a universal for PUMPKIN SPICE LATTE.
  - Hard question: Russell says that every sentence has a universal in it. Tricky case: Peter Parker is Spiderman. (If you don't like fictional examples, use Onika Tanya Maraj-Petty is Nicki Minaj.)
  - Does that have a universal in it? I think BR would say it's the 'is'. But the 'is' there is the 'is' of self-identity, and being self-identical is not a form of resemblence. Everything is self-identical, so the self-identical things don't resemble each other.
  
Mind-Dependent
  - BR very concerns to argue that universals represent mind-independent facts about reality.
  - The example he uses is wild: Edinburgh is north of London.
  - Seems to me that Edinburgh and London are mind-dependent entities. That doesn't just mean that they were caused by minds (though they were), or that 'London' means London because of mind.
  - I mean that if we all agreed that London was somewhere different, it would be.
  - If we all came to believe that UM was in a separate city from AA, perhaps a new city called Wolverineville, that would kind of do it.
  - The metaphysics of cities I think is really hard, and the toy theory Russell has, that 'London' names a point on the earth's surface, isn't actually that plausible. It's conceptually possible that London is 10 miles west of where it used to be, but it's not conceptually possible that a point is ten miles west of where it used to be.
  - And the other example is WHITENESS, but I think that's really mind-dependent; whether something is white just is whether it looks white to normal observers in normal conditions. That's mind-dependent.
  - Anyway look, we could do all this with fusion reactions inside the Sun. That there are fusion reactions inside the Sun is not mind-dependent, so the universal FUSION REACTION is not mind-dependent.
