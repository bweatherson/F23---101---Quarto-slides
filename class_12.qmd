# The Very Big Picture {background-color="#40666e"}

## Aims of these Chapters

- In chapter 14, the focus is largely on what philosophy can't do.
- In chapter 15, the focus turns back to what philosophy can do, which has become more pressing given the negative results of chapter 14.

## Is Russell Right?

I'm going to make two negative points.

1. The rather strange last few paragraphs aren't really consistent with (the more plausible) things Russell says earlier.
2. Russell underestimates the importance of continued interactions with other disciplines.

## Russell's Negative View

Philosophy (as he understands it) can't tell us much about the world.

- It can't tell us that the universe is fundamentally one absolute (as Hegel maybe said).
- It can't tell us that this is the best of all possible worlds (as Leibniz said).
- It can't tell us that matter is unreal (as Berkeley said).

## Russell's Negative View

He's relying here on an idea that gets its clearest formulation in David Hume's work (and will be of some importance starting next week).

- The only things one can know by pure contemplation, by reasoning that does not start with observation of the world, are things whose negation is incoherent.
- For any of these interesting philosophical claims, the negation is coherent.

## Russell's Positive View

In chapter 15, Russell goes through four things.

1. Philosophy gives birth to disciplines.
2. Philosophy helps us ask good questions.
3. Philosophy helps us see that there are more answers to these questions than might have seemed apparent.
4. Philosophy, by focussing on universal truths, removes us from our partial perspective.

I'm going to agree with 1-3, not with 4.

## Contra Hegel

I don't know enough about Hegel to know how fair Russell is being here.

My suspicion is that he isn't very fair, but I don't know.

Still, there's a somewhat interesting argument he attributes to Hegel.

## The Interconnectedness of All Things

Here's an argument, that relies on no real empirical support, for the conclusion that all things are interconnected.

1. If you know everything there is to know about any one thing, you know all there is to know about the universe.
2. Therefore, all things are connected; everything that happens in the universe is in some sense a part of every thing.

## The Interconnectedness of All Things

The first premise can seem plausible with a bit of thought.

Say that a fact is about a thing if the fact is of the form "The thing is ...", and what comes after is a long description of some attribute.

That doesn't sound too implausible put that way.

## The Interconnectedness of All Things

But it can lead to some extreme results. Think about this remote control. 

- The remote control is the property of the University of Michigan, which is a university in the United States, which is a country whose first President was George Washington, who had wooden teeth.â€œ
