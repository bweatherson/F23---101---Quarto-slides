# The Very Big Picture {background-color="#40666e"}

## Aims of these Chapters

- In chapter 14, the focus is largely on what philosophy can't do.
- In chapter 15, the focus turns back to what philosophy can do, which has become more pressing given the negative results of chapter 14.

## Reading Guide

For Russell:

- Chapters 14 and 15 are kind of a unit, first on what philosophy can't do, and then on what it can do. You should read them together.

For Hume:

- Part (i.e., chapter) 1 is stage-setting that makes sense in the context of 18th century theological debates, but is less helpful now. It is interesting, especially if you're familiar with some of this stuff, but we're going to mostly talk about Part 2.

## Hume Versions

In the 'Files' section of Canvas, I've included pdf, mobi, and epub versions of Jonathan Bennett's 'translated' version of Hume's Dialogues.

I kind of prefer Hume's original prose, but I did notice that it was easier to follow who was speaking in the Bennett version.

If you're doing really close reading, what does this paragraph, even this sentence, mean - then it might be useful to have both open.

## iClicker Starting Quiz

In Chapter 14, Russell talks about the 'limits of philosophical knowledge'. What does he mean by this?

 A.  The areas of knowledge that philosophy cannot penetrate.
 B.  The limitations philosophers face due to lack of empirical evidence.
 C.  The degree to which philosophy can compete with scientific disciplines.
 D.  The point where philosophical knowledge turns into wisdom.

## Is Russell Right?

I'm going to make two negative points.

1. The rather strange last few paragraphs aren't really consistent with (the more plausible) things Russell says earlier.
2. Russell underestimates the importance of continued interactions with other disciplines.

## Russell's Negative View

Philosophy (as he understands it) can't tell us much about the world.

- It can't tell us that the universe is fundamentally one absolute (as Hegel maybe said).
- It can't tell us that this is the best of all possible worlds (as Leibniz said).
- It can't tell us that matter is unreal (as Berkeley said).

## Russell's Negative View

He's relying here on an idea that gets its clearest formulation in David Hume's work (and will be of some importance starting next week).

- The only things one can know by pure contemplation, by reasoning that does not start with observation of the world, are things whose negation is incoherent.
- For any of these interesting philosophical claims, the negation is coherent.

## Russell's Positive View

In chapter 15, Russell goes through four things.

1. Philosophy gives birth to disciplines.
2. Philosophy helps us ask good questions.
3. Philosophy helps us see that there are more answers to these questions than might have seemed apparent.
4. Philosophy, by focussing on universal truths, removes us from our partial perspective.

I'm going to agree with 1-3, not with 4.

## Contra Hegel

I don't know enough about Hegel to know how fair Russell is being here.

My suspicion is that he isn't very fair, but I don't know.

Still, there's a somewhat interesting argument he attributes to Hegel.

## The Interconnectedness of All Things

Here's an argument, that relies on no real empirical support, for the conclusion that all things are interconnected.

1. If you know everything there is to know about any one thing, you know all there is to know about the universe.
2. Therefore, all things are connected; everything that happens in the universe is in some sense a part of every thing.

## The Interconnectedness of All Things

The first premise can seem plausible with a bit of thought.

Say that a fact is about a thing if the fact is of the form "The thing is ...", and what comes after is a long description of some attribute.

That doesn't sound too implausible put that way.

## The Interconnectedness of All Things

But it can lead to some extreme results. Think about this remote control. 

- The remote control is the property of the University of Michigan, which is a university in the United States, which is a country whose first President was George Washington, who had wooden teeth.
- Knowing all there is to know about the remote control implies knowing that George Washington had wooden teeth.
- And the same kind of trick looks like it will work for any fact in the universe, with a bit of imagination.

## Aboutness

I think that this shows that we have to give up this background assumption:

- A fact is about a thing if the fact is of the form "The thing is ...", and what comes after is a long description of some attribute.
- The remote control example was silly, but there are simpler cases that I think make the same point.
- E.g., the remote control was made the same year that Taylor Swift released the new version of _Red_.
- That's not a fact _about_ the remote in the intended sense.

At this stage it would be great to say, here's a simple theory of aboutness that explains what is going on.

I don't have such a theory.

If you're interested in a complicated but very fascinating theory, here's a 2014 book with a beautiful cover that goes into some detail.

## Limits and Promises

There is a general example from this kind of case.

- Attempts to come up with grand theories of the world from purely philosophical reflection don't have a great track record in actually creating good theories.
- But that doesn't mean they are worthless.
- Sometimes seeing what they assume generates good questions, e.g., what is aboutness.
 
## Good Questions

And sometimes those questions have practical upshots.

- My sense is that a big part of the reason 2020s language models (like GPT) are better than 2010s language models (based on things like LDA) is that they have a better theory of aboutness built into their architecture.
- That's not to say it's a _good_ theory, in fact I think it's kind of terrible, but it's a _better_ theory than what we had in the 2010s. And maybe the 2030s, or even late 2020s, will use an even better one. 

# The Birth of Disciplines {background-color="#40666e"} 

## Newton and Beyond

Russell mentions that Isaac Newton, one of the greatest ever physicists, worked in what was then called _natural philosophy_.

The name isn't a coincidence; physics was really part of philosophy then.

If Newton hadn't come along, maybe we'd remember Ren√© Descartes as the greatest physicist of that generation.

And Newton had a long (and acrimonious) correspondence with the Gottfried Leibniz.

## Newton and Beyond

But Newton did come along, and one of the consequences of his work was that making further progress in physics required more specialised skills.

And so physics programs, homes for people with those specialised skills, were born.

## Philosophy as Discipline Generator

That's one of the things Russell thinks is really valuable about philosophy.

Every so often, it generates a whole new, and really valuable, discipline.

Two examples of this that are not in Russell's book are from Russell's life.

## Cambridge (UK) Philosophy

There is [online](https://www.irwincollier.com/cambridge-on-the-moral-sciences-tripos-james-ward-editor-1891/) a handbook for what the "Moral Sciences" program at Cambridge was in 1891, which would have been when Russell was 19.

What they called moral sciences was roughly what we'd call philosophy; at least it was 60% what we'd definitely call philosophy.

But it was also 20% psychology, and 20% economics.

## Cambridge (UK) Philosophy

Even that's a bit misleading. The psychology was very theoretical, and most of the people they read were people we'd now think of as philosophers, like William James.

And the economics was what became known as political economy, more like PPE than just economics.

The key point for us is that within a generation, both of these were separate departments.

## Cambridge (UK) Philosophy

This wasn't because Cambridge was weak in economics and psychology, and had to catch up by generating departments.

I don't know the history of the psychology program there well enough to say, but it was probably the best economics program in the English-speaking world at the time, and it was part of philosophy.

## More Recent Cases

That said, this was a hundred years ago. We might ask what philosophy has done for the university recently.

And here the big thing has been not the creation of brand new programs, but the filling in of gaps.

That's what happened at Michigan in the 2010s.

## Two New Majors

Two of the newest majors on campus are Cognitive Science and PPE.

Cog Sci is a joint project of Psychology, Linguistics, and Philosophy.

And PPE, as the name suggests, is a joint project of Politics, Philosophy, and Economics.

And in each case it was less the creation of a new field, and more a recognition that there was a gap in our collective coverage, falling between the members of the field.

## Physics and Metaphysics

It hasn't become a major yet, and maybe it never will, but at some universities you see similar things with work at the overlap between (or in the space between) physics and philosophy.

Work at the foundation of physics these days is not just about (a) better experiments, and (b) better mathematical theories to predict what will happen, but also (c) how to understand these theories.

And (at least in my opinion) the best work on that front comes from interaction between philosophers and physicists.

# Philosophy and the Universal {background-color="#40666e"} 

## Two Russellian Claims

Let's jump to the very end of Russell's book. He says two things that I think are in some tension.

1. It's very important to be connected to the world. Part of what's valuable about knowledge is that knowledge requires an integration of knower and the world that is known.
2. Philosophy is valuable because it makes us focus on universal claims and that means we don't rely on our partial perspective.

## The Problem

Let's say we focus on abstract things, like Russell wants, e.g., _Is there a largest set_?

- The problem is that we're not really connecting to the world, so we're not getting the value in 1.
- You're not really integrating yourself into your community or your world by thinking hard about whether there is a largest set.
- It's true that because of that, you can think about set theory in a way that is less sensitive to your prejudices, biases, idiosyncratic limitations, etc.

## Why Choose?

What's odd is why Russell thinks we need to choose between engaging with the empirical world (clearly a valuable thing), and figuring out abstract facts in ways that don't engage various biases (also clearly valuable).

The end of the book is a weird argument for one of these things that seems to miss the value of the other.

## Realism

Russell's book was a clear statement of a kind of realist attitude to the world that was unusual in philosophy at the time, but became much more so over the 20th century, especially the second half.

Realism is a very natural view; it sure looks at first glance like there's a mind-independent world we can know about. But it raises deep questions, and this book was an interesting attempt to set out what those questions are and how to answer them.

## Some questions

- What must the world have to ground the facts we seem to perceive? (Russell: At least particulars and universals.)
- What are minds like that they can both perceive the world, and think false thoughts? (Russell offers the multiple relation theory here, though few followed him.)
- How do we perceive the world? (Russell thinks we just directly perceive our own mind, and then infer out.)
- How do we make these inferences? (Russell gives a key role to induction)
- These are all pressing questions today.

## For Next Time

- We'll go back in time, and aim for even deeper philosophical questions, looking at David Hume's discussion of the Design Argument for the existence of God.

- Hume is going to give us three characters, one of whom (Cleanthes) is going to argue that the world resembles designed things, so it is designed, so it has a designer, so God exists.

- And the other characters, living 100 years before Darwin, are going to throw everything they have at that argument, but Cleanthes isn't going to back down.
