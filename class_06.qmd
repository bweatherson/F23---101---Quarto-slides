# Three Ways to Object

## A Bad Argument

### Hopefully everyone will agree that this is in fact bad

1. Brian's jokes are funny.
2. Therefore, Brian's lectures are good.

## Three Objections

### There might be multiple variants of these three

:::{.incremental}
1. Object to the premise - the jokes are not funny. (There are jokes?)
2. Object to the reasonining from premise to conclusion - good jokes are not important to a lecture.
3. Object to the conclusion - the lectures are bad for some other reason.

## Argument Maps

### Graphical Representation of the three objections

The map of the initial argument makes it look like there should be three places to object.

[Brian's lectures are good.]
   + <a1>
      + [Brian's jokes are funny.]
      
## Argument Maps

### Graphical Representation of the three objections
  
One annoyance is that the representation uses color, and not 100% of people can see the color differences.

The graphs use red for objections, and green for support.

There is also slightly different shading, which hopefully helps if red and green look similar to you.

## Objecting to the premise

![](argdown/06_02.png)

[Brian's lectures are good.]
   + <a1>
      + [Brian's jokes are funny.]
          - [I didn't see a joke.]
