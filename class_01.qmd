## Course Overview

### Four major parts

:::{.incremental}
1. Critical Thinking
2. Bertrand Russell's 1912 book _The Problems of Philosophy_.

## Assessment

### What You Have to Do

TKTK

## Canvas

### Where you find everything

This course, like pretty much all courses, has a canvas site.

Go to [canvas.umich.edu](https://canvas.umich.edu), and you should find it easily enough.

It has the **syllabus**, links to the readings, these slides (as they are written).

## Books

### Also on Canvas

Under 'Files' on Canvas, I've put links to both

- The Project Gutenberg versions of the books; and
- The versions that I made which I think are easier to read, but your mileage may vary.

## iClicker

### One way to engage in class

This class will use [iClicker](https://www.iclicker.com) in class. This will take attendance, but also let us run **polls** and **quizzes**.

Note that a **poll** is where I just want to know what you think, you'll get full marks for any answer.

A **quiz** is where I want you to get the right answer. This will primarily be about the reading.

You need to set up the iClicker software (which is free for UM students) asap.

## Asking Questions

This isn't just a scripted performance from me. You can stop me and ask questions.

In fact, does anyone have questions so far?

. . .


Still, this is primarily about me talking. The discussion sections should be, if all goes well, primarily about you talking.

## Canvas Chat

### Yet Another Engagement Mechanism

There is also a group chat facility, helpfully called 'Chat', in Canvas.

During class, the discussion section leaders will monitor this, answer questions that come up, and let me know if lots of people have the same question.

I've tried using these before and, to be honest, it hasn't been a great success. But if there is something that you want to bring up, and you'd rather not raise your hand in a large auditorium, that's an option.

# What is Philosophy {background-color="#40666e"}

## The Big Question

### That a 101 course should answer

For courses that are not offered at most high schools, like sociology, linguistics, or **philosophy**, it's common in 101 to say what we are, and what you get out of a course like this.

Unfortunately, this is a little harder in philosophy than some other disciplines.

I've heard even of courses that organise their entire introductory course around the question "What is Philosophy?"

## The Big Question

### With an answer

I'm not going to do that for two reasons.

### {.incremental}
1. It sounds really dire.
2. There is a simple answer - philosophy is theory.
###

## Philosophy as Theory

### What does that mean

In many subjects at UM, there is be some course with the term 'theory' or 'theoretical' in the title, or which says in the introduction that it is taking a more theoretical approach to questions.

Philosophy is what is covered in all those courses.

## Philosophy as Theory

### What does that mean

That implies that there are people doing philosophy across a whole range of departments at UM, or any other university.

One exciting thing about being at UM is that people tend to do philosophy very well across the university, something that isn't guaranteed even at good universities.

## And More

### This could go all day

There are courses in physics, economics, English literature, gender studies, and many more that are like this.

The philosophy department has faculty cross-listed with law, linguistics, African American studies, Asian Languages and Culture, and so on.

My work overlaps a lot with economics, and that might come through in what I teach here.

## What is Covered in Theory Courses

### Three Big Topics

1. Aims
2. Methods
3. Themes

## What is Covered in Theory Courses

### Aims

- What are we trying to do in this kind of study?
- What are the practitioners trying to do in the work we're studying, and should they be trying to do that?

The first is more important when theorising about physics, the second when theorising about politics. (I guess both are important in theorising about art.)

## What is Covered in Theory Courses

### Methods

- How do we (or the practitioners) go about achieving those aims?

FWIW, most of the research work I do falls into this category.

## What is Covered in Theory Courses

### Themes

- The more general a question, the more likely it is to turn up in a theory course.
- Theory is when we move from questions about this chemical element, or this painter, to questions about all chemical elements, or all painters.
- And philosophers tend to interact with people in other disciplines most often when they are working at this very general level.



## Why Philosophy?

### Why not just have theorists in every other department?

Because these theoretical debates often turn out to have a lot in common. Knowing something about some of them helps with the other ones.

And there are very general things, especially about the nature of reasoning, but also about the nature of very general things like value, knowledge, existence, causation, etc, that are helpful across the various debates.

And that's what philosophy does.

## Best Philosophy

### Why not both?

When I say some course elsewhere 'overlaps' with philosophy, does that mean that you should just listen to us, or that what we do is redundant?

:::{.incremental}
- No, both courses are valuable.
- To do theoretical work on X, it helps to know a lot about X, and a lot about the nature of the theoretical questions involved.
- Different courses, and different profs, will help with each.

# Parts of Philosophy {background-color="#40666e"}

## A Brief Guide

### This is mostly so you recognise the words

I'm going to list eight areas of philosophy that a lot of courses cover.

- Some courses cover things outside this list.
- More commonly, we have courses that cover many parts of this list.

## Important Topics in Philosophy

1. **Ethics** - how to live.
2. **Epistemology** - what we can know, and how to reason well.
3. **Metaphysics** - what the world is like, at a fundamental level.
4. **Political Philosophy** - how to live together.
5. **Aesthetics** - art, beauty, fiction, and related topics.
6. **Philosophy of Mind** - what (human) minds are like.
7. **Philosophy of Language** - how (human) language works.
8. **Logic** - formal theories of implication.

## History

### Commitment to the record

As well as these topics, we spend a lot of time in philosophy studying, and archiving, the history of study into them.

In other disciplines this is sometimes offered as a very obscure topic.

In philosophy it's central to the discipline.

## Internal Overlaps

### Courses that cover many parts

Some philosophy courses look at philosophical topics from a certain perspective, or as they come up in certain contexts. These will cover many of these areas.

:::{.incremental}
- Feminist philosophy courses might look at feminist ethical and political theories, but also feminist approaches to metaphysics, epistemology, and language.
- Philosophy of science courses look at metaphysical, epistemological, and ethical/political questions that arise in science.
:::

## External Overlaps (Very Roughly)

| Area of Philosophy | External Discipline |
|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|   Ethics           |     Everything      |
|   Epistemology     |     Everything      |
|   Metaphysics      |      Physics        |
|   Political Philosophy |  Political Science  |
|   Aesthetics       |     Art, Film, etc  |
|   Philosophy of Language  |  Linguistics  |
|   Philosophy of Mind  |  Psychology  |
|    Logic           |    Mathematics  |

## Ethics and Epistemology

### Why everywhere?

Because in every discipline you need to think about:

1. How do we find out about the part of the world that we're studying?
2. What should we do with that information.

The first is epistemology, the second is ethics. And they are unavoidable subjects.

## Metaphysics and Physics

### Hang on a second

Is physics the study of what the world is really like, at the most fundamental level?

Not on most theological pictures.

And in the history of philosophy, metaphysics was more closely connected to theology than to physics, and we'll see that in Hume's _Dialogues_.

## Metaphysics and Epistemology

### The world is knowable

Another thing we'll see, and Russell will have a lot to say about this, is the connection between our theories of what the world fundamentally is like, and our theories for how we can know about the world.

A running concern over millennia is that if the world is as it appears, we couldn't possibly know about it. And this leads to some _interesting_ metaphysical views.

This will come up in Russell's _Problems of Philosophy_.

# For Next Time {background-color="#40666e"}

## Reading

### Yes there's reading

Read chapter 1 of P. D. Magnus's (freely available) logic text _forall x_.

This is available on Canvas.

We are not doing logic in this course, but we need the basic concepts.
