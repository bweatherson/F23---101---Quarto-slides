# Validity and Form {background-color="#40666e"}

## Sentence Letters

### A useful shorthand

We're going to use $X$ and $Y$ to stand for possible sentences.

So $X$ might be _Brian had bacon and eggs for breakfast_, or _There is a T-Rex on the diag_, or _Seven plus five is twelve_, or any other sentence.

## Combining Sentences

### The mortar of logic

And one of the basic things you do in logic is think about sentences that are built from relatively simple sentences like those. In particular, we're going to talk a little about these four types of sentences.

- $X$ and $Y$.
- $X$ or $Y$.
- If $X$ then $Y$.
- Not $X$.

Yes! (I guess that's in the title)

The premise says that both $X$ and $Y$ are true, and that guarantees that $X$ is true.

But the way we tell that is more interesting.

## Showing that a Form is Invalid

### Look for a clearly bad instance

To show that an argument form is invalid, what we do is find values for $X$, $Y$, and any other sentences there are, that make the premises true and the conclusion not true.

In this case the following will work:

- $X$ is _Brian came to work today_.
- $Y$ is _Brian rode a T-Rex this morning_.

Hopefully it's clear that **Argument One** is valid.

If you tell me that if $X$ is true, so is $Y$, and you tell me that $X$ is in fact true, hard to know what more conclusive reason you could give for $Y$.

:::

## Argument Two

We need to find an instance where the premises are true, ideally that they are clearly true, and that the conclusion is not true.

. . .

Here's one possibility.

1. If Brian is in Columbus, Ohio, then he is not in New York City.
2. Brian is not in New York City.
C.  Brian is in Columbus, Ohio. \ \ \ \ \

1. If Brian is in Detroit, then he is in Michigan.
2. Brian is not in Detroit.
C.  Brian is not in Michigan. \ \ \ \ \

## Argument Four

This one is a bit trickier, but here's the rough reasoning.

- A valid argument means the following is impossible: true premises, not true conclusion.
- Assume we have true premises, false conclusion. So it's not true that $X$ is not true.
- That means it's true that $X$.
- And it's true that If $X$ then $Y$.
- Putting those things together $Y$ must be true, but the second premise says it is not true, so what we assumed is impossible.

## Don't Switch Things Around

### Perhaps the most common logical misstep

I've been going over these a bit slowly because it is one of the most common slips in practice.

In these cases, arguments that can lead to absurd conclusions look a lot like arguments that are valid.

They just involve switching some letters around.

That turns out to be one of the most common forms of slip-ups.
